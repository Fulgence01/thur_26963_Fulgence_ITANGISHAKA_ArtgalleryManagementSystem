## Conclusion
The Art Gallery Management System successfully demonstrates how Oracle PL/SQL can be used to build a secure, audit-ready, and highly structured database solution. Through the use of well-designed tables, enforced relationships, triggers, procedures, functions, and packages, the system supports core gallery operations such as managing artists, artworks, exhibitions, sales, and customer data.

Security is implemented using role-based access control and DML restrictions to protect data integrity, while auditing ensures accountability by tracking and reporting all sensitive activities. These features not only improve reliability but also align the project with real-world standards for operational systems.

This project highlights a complete cycle of database development — from logical modeling to implementation, testing, and documentation — making it a robust capstone showcase of database and PL/SQL skills.
